Main Method = The entry point of a Java program

public static void main(String[] args) {
        *CODE*
}

public = Needs to be public so that the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) can access and execute it.
static = Needs to be static so that the JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method without creating an instance of the class first.
void = Return type is void because the main function shouldn't return anything, when it finishes executing, the Java program simply terminates.
String[] args = accepts arguments from the command line that are stored in a String array to affect the operation of the program.


Data Structures = Named location used to store and organize data
Ex: Array = A collection of elements stores in contiguous memory locations.

Algorithm = A collection of steps to solve a problem
Ex: Linear Search = Examining the elements of an array one by one to find a value.

DATA STRUCTURES

Stack = LIFO data structure (Last in first out).
Stores objects as a "vertical tower", like a stack of books or cds.
push() method is used to add objects to the top.
pop() method is used to remove from the top.
