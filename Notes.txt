Main Method = The entry point of a Java program

public static void main(String[] args) {
        *CODE*
}

public = Needs to be public so that the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) can access and execute it.
static = Needs to be static so that the JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method without creating an instance of the class first.
void = Return type is void because the main function shouldn't return anything, when it finishes executing, the Java program simply terminates.
String[] args = accepts arguments from the command line that are stored in a String array to affect the operation of the program.


Data Structures = Named location used to store and organize data
Ex: Array = A collection of elements stores in contiguous memory locations.

Algorithm = A collection of steps to solve a problem
Ex: Linear Search = Examining the elements of an array one by one to find a value.

DATA STRUCTURES

STACK
LIFO data structure (Last in first out).
Stores objects as a "vertical tower", like a stack of books or cds.
push() method is used to add objects to the top.
pop() method is used to remove from the top.

QUEUE
FIFO data structure (First in first out)
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
Linear data structure (a data structure that stores data sequentially)
Head = First element of the queue
Tail = Lst element of the queue
enqueue = adding an object to the end of the queue
dequeue = removing an object from the head of the queue

Priority Queue
A FIFO data structure that serves elements with the highest priority first before elements with lower priority
Its like a normal queue, but you sort the elements first based on a parameter, so you can serve the elements
with the highest priority first and work your way down to the lowest priority.
